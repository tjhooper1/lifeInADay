# üï∞Ô∏è Life Clock

## Description
Life Clock is a simple, yet intriguing web application that provides a different perspective on age. Inspired by a concept from musician John Mayer, this application visualizes one's lifespan as a 24-hour day and calculates the current "time" based on the user's age.

## How it works
Users input their age, and the application calculates what time it would be if their entire lifespan was condensed into a single day, with the average lifespan set as 72 years. For instance, if a user is 36 years old (which is half of 72), the application will display "12:00 PM".

## How to use
1. Open the web application in your browser.
2. You will see an input box and a digital clock display that defaults to 00:00.
3. Enter your age in the input box and press the Enter key or click the Submit button.
4. The digital clock display will update to show the "time" in your life.

## Share Feature
After discovering what time it is in their life, users can share this unique concept with their friends on Facebook using the built-in share feature.

## Running Locally
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
3. Enter your age and see what time it is!
